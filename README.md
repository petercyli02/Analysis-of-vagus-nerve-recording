# IIB-Project-cl854

Master's project on processing and analysing vagnus nerve data from rats.

Initial objective was on machine learning for glucose classification from vagus nerve time series data. The focus then shifted to motion artifact removal - an important step in cleaning the noisy data recorded from free-moving rats.

Current focus is an developing a GUI for video analysis for manually identifying motion artifacts.
